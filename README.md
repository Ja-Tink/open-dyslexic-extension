# Open Dyslexic Browser Extension

This is a Chrome browser extension that changes the font of a page to Open Dyslexic (a dyslexic-friendly font) and back to its original version with the press of the extension button.

Open Dyslexic was created by Abbie Gonzalez and can be found [here](https://github.com/antijingoist/opendyslexic).
